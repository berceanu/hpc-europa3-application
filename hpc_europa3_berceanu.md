# HPC-Europa3 Application

## Project Proposal

### Background information

(4000 characters): current status of your research
activities, the objectives you set at the start of this project and more
generally, how your work will contribute to developments in your research
field

### Case for HPC-EUROPA funding

(4000 characters): demonstrate how your research
would benefit from accessing HPC-Europa HPC systems or interacting with your
local scientific host. If you wish to simulate larger systems than you
currently are you should 1. justify the necessity to simulate larger systems
for the problem being studied; and 2. demonstrate that the resources to which
you currently have access are inadequate for this purpose.

## Project Workplan

(4000 characters): Make sure that in your workplan is
included a list of specific objectives and an approximate timeline for these,
as this is very important. We strongly encourage you to propose a
weekly-based workplan.
