<h3 id="status-of-my-research-activities">1.1. Status of my research activities</h3>
<p>I have completed my PhD in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics at Universidad Autonoma (Spain) and am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics (Romania). In my new role, I am focusing on theoretical/computational aspects of high power laser-plasma interaction, in particular accelerating particles to megaelectronvolt energies using plasma wakefields, with the goal of obtaining high-brilliance/high-energy secondary radiation sources with various applications in medical imaging, as well as fundamental research.</p>
<p>Tajima and Dawson’s seminal 1979 paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 43 (4): 267–70, (1979)] first introduced the idea that particles could be accelerated to high energies using laser-plasma interaction instead of the conventional RF accelerators. The main concept was that the plasma would be perturbed by the laser and act as a transformer, conveying the laser energy to the particles. Subsequent experimental developments, in particular the chirped pulse amplification lead to the advent of high-power lasers, which brought Tajima and Dawson’s idea to reality. The main advantage of using a plasma instead of a conventional accelerator is that the electric field gradients it can withstand are about three orders of magnitude higher than the breakdown fields of an RF cavity. This allows one to use much shorter acceleration distances, on the order of centimeters (instead of kilometers) and achieve similar energies, with the current state of the art of a few GeV. This acceleration process goes by the name of laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA), due to the wake that the laser leaves behind it in the plasma. A breakthrough occured in 2004, when Pukhov and coworkers [Plasma physics and controlled fusion, 46 (2004)], using numerical simulations, discovered a new regime of LWFA: the so-called “bubble” regime, allowing for the first time the production of mono-energetic electron bunches that approach the quality of those obtained in conventional accelerators.</p>
<p>This discovery was quickly confirmed by three experiments [Nature 431:541 (2004), Nature 431:535 (2004), Nature 431:538 (2004)]. In the bubble regime, the laser creates a spherical cavity devoid of electrons behind it, as it enters the plasma. The size of the cavity is proportional to the plasma wavelength, and it propagates with a phase velocity equal to the laser group velocity. There are several ways of injecting electrons from the background plasma into this cavity, ranging from self-injection (simplest) to ionization and colliding pulse injection. The bubble is positively charged due to the background ions, and it has a linear accelerating field along the laser propagation direction, as well as radial focusing fields, which help keep the electron bunch emittance low. Unde the action of the radial fields, the injected electrons which are deviated from the propagation axis start to oscillate around it, emitting synchrotron radiation, technically know as betatron radiation. The mechanism of radiation emission is similar to what happens to an electron bunch propagating inside an undulator, with the role of the undulator played by the background plasma. The betatron spectrum usually extends to the X-ray spectral region, due to the relativistic Doppler shift involved.</p>
<p>The method used by Pukhov is a well established numerical approach in the plasma physics community and goes by the name of “particle-in-cell” (PIC), being developed in the early 1960’s by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others. In a nutshell, one models the plasma as a collections of macro-particles, each of which correspond to thousands of real particles. The main PIC loop consists of: (1) integrating the relativistic Lorentz-Newton equations of motion for the macro-particles, (2) interpolating the resulting charges and currents to the mesh, (3) computing the electromagnetic (EM) fields on the mesh and (4) interpolating the EM fields to the positions of the macroparticles. Since we are dealing with around a billion macro-particles in a typical simulation, and hundreds of thousands of time steps, PIC simulations require large distributed computational resources, but also provide the most accurate description of the plasma evolution, short of solving the 6-dimensional Vlasov-Boltzman equations.</p>
<h3 id="project-objectives">1.2. Project objectives</h3>
<p>The main project objective is using the emitted betatron radiation as a non-intercepting, single-shot diagnostic tool for the properties of the accelerated electron bunch. The basic algorithm is described in a recent publication of the Frascati group [A. Curcio et. al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 111, 133105 (2017)], and, in a nutshell, it amounts to measuring both the electron, as well as betatron energy spectra and obtaining the (radial) beam profile from the system’s S-matrix. In a related paper [A. Curcio et. al, Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 20, 012801 (2017)], the same group reconstructed both the beam profile, as well as the radial emittance of the electron beam, finally obtaining the trace-space density of the beam.</p>
<p>Both these experiments we perfomed using a pure Helium gas jet, with the FLAME laser with operating at 1 J pulse energy, 30 fs FWHM@intensity pulse duration. The electrons reached <span class="math inline">\(\sim 300\)</span> MeV energies in an accelerating length <span class="math inline">\(\gtrapprox 1\)</span> mm. These studies used a 1D model, assuming a cylindrically symetric electron bunch distribution. Our objective is to extend this work to the 2D case, allowing one to reconstruct the 2D emittance and spatial bunch profile. This would require an angularly-resolved measurement of the betatron emission spectrum and electron energy spectrum, as well as large scale numerical modelling using the PIC method.</p>
<p>A preliminary experimental setup is shown in the attached image. The laser beam (red) is focused by the off-axis parabola (OAP) down to a few micrometers spot size at the entrance of the gas jet. The probe beam is used for interferometric imaging of the plasma on the CCD camera, and the accelerated electrons are deflected by a magnetic dipole onto a LANEX screen for spectral measurements. The emitted betatron radiation (pink) goes through an X-ray scintillator onto an X-ray CCD which retrieves its spectral information.</p>

<p>A further goal of the project is to improve the trapping and general properties of the electron beam. For example, the beam emittance could be improved by using different injection schemes such as self-truncated ionization injection [ref] by adding a small percentage of Nitrogen doping to the Helium gas. The beam energy could be increased by using a capillary to guide the laser pulse over a longer propagating distance, up to a few centimeters, at a lower plasma density.</p>
