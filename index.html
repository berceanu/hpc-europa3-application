<h3 id="status-of-my-research-activities">1.1. Status of my research activities</h3>
<p>I completed my PhD in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain) and am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics (Romania). In my new role, I am focusing on theoretical/computational aspects of high power laser-plasma interaction, in particular accelerating particles to megaelectronvolt energies using plasma wakefields, with the goal of obtaining high-brilliance/high-energy secondary radiation sources with various applications in medical imaging, as well as fundamental research.</p>
<p>Tajima and Dawson’s seminal 1979 paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 43 (4): 267–70, (1979)] first introduced the idea that particles could be accelerated to high energies using laser-plasma interaction instead of the conventional RF accelerators. The main concept was that the plasma would be perturbed by the laser and act as a transformer, conveying the laser energy to the particles. Subsequent experimental developments, in particular the chirped pulse amplification lead to the advent of high-power lasers, which brought Tajima and Dawson’s idea to reality. The main advantage of using a plasma instead of a conventional accelerator is that the electric field gradients it can withstand are about three orders of magnitude higher than the breakdown fields of an RF cavity. This allows one to use much shorter acceleration distances, on the order of centimeters (instead of kilometers) and achieve similar energies, with the current state of the art of a few GeV. This acceleration process goes by the name of laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA), due to the wake that the laser leaves behind it in the plasma. A breakthrough occurred in 2004, when Pukhov and coworkers [Plasma physics and controlled fusion, 46 (2004)], using numerical simulations, discovered a new regime of LWFA: the so-called“bubble” regime, allowing for the first time the production of mono-energetic electron bunches that approach the quality of those obtained in conventional accelerators.</p>
<p>This discovery was quickly confirmed by three experiments [Nature 431:541 (2004), Nature 431:535 (2004), Nature 431:538 (2004)]. In the bubble regime, the laser creates a spherical cavity devoid of electrons behind it, as it enters the plasma. The size of the cavity is proportional to the plasma wavelength, and it propagates with a phase velocity equal to the laser group velocity. There are several ways of injecting electrons from the background plasma into this cavity, ranging from self-injection (simplest) to ionization and colliding pulse injection. The bubble is positively charged due to the background ions, and it has a linear accelerating field along the laser propagation direction, as well as radial focusing fields, which help keep the electron bunch emittance low. Under the action of the radial fields, the injected electrons which are deviated from the propagation axis start to oscillate around it, emitting synchrotron radiation, technically know as betatron radiation. The mechanism of radiation emission is similar to what happens to an electron bunch propagating inside an undulator, with the role of the undulator played by the background plasma. The betatron spectrum usually extends to the X-ray spectral region, due to the relativistic Doppler shift involved.</p>
<p>The method used by Pukhov is a well established numerical approach in the plasma physics community and goes by the name of “particle-in-cell” (PIC), being developed in the early 1960’s by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others. In a nutshell, one models the plasma as a collections of macro-particles, each of which correspond to thousands of real particles. The main PIC loop consists of: (1) integrating the relativistic Lorentz-Newton equations of motion for the macro-particles, (2) interpolating the resulting charges and currents to the mesh, (3) computing the electromagnetic (EM) fields on the mesh and (4) interpolating the EM fields to the positions of the macroparticles. Since we are dealing with around a billion macro-particles in a typical simulation, and hundreds of thousands of time steps, PIC simulations require large distributed computational resources, but also provide the most accurate description of the plasma evolution, short of solving the 6-dimensional Vlasov-Boltzman equations.</p>
<h3 id="project-objectives">1.2. Project objectives</h3>
<p>The main project objective is using the emitted betatron radiation as a non-intercepting, single-shot diagnostic tool for the properties of the accelerated electron bunch. The basic algorithm is described in a recent publication of the Frascati group [A. Curcio et. al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 111, 133105 (2017)], and, in a nutshell, it amounts to measuring both the electron, as well as betatron energy spectra and obtaining the (radial) beam profile from the system’s S-matrix. In a related paper [A. Curcio et. al, Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 20, 012801 (2017)], the same group reconstructed both the beam profile, as well as the radial emittance of the electron beam, finally obtaining the trace-space density of the beam.</p>
<p>Both these experiments we performed using a pure Helium gas jet, with the FLAME laser [F.G. Bisesto et. al, Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A 909, 452 (2018)] operating at 1 J pulse energy, 30 fs FWHM@intensity pulse duration. The electrons reached <span class="math inline">\(\sim 300\)</span> MeV energies in an accelerating length <span class="math inline">\(\gtrapprox 1\)</span> mm. These studies used a 1D model, assuming a cylindrically symmetric electron bunch distribution. Our objective is to extend this work to the 2D case, allowing one to reconstruct the 2D emittance and spatial bunch profile. This would require an angularly-resolved measurement of the betatron emission spectrum and electron energy spectrum, as well as large scale numerical modelling using the PIC method.</p>
<p>A preliminary experimental setup is shown in the attached image. The laser beam (red) is focused by the off-axis parabola (OAP) down to a few micrometers spot size at the entrance of the gas jet. The probe beam is used for interferometric imaging of the plasma on the CCD camera, and the accelerated electrons are deflected by a magnetic dipole onto a LANEX screen for spectral measurements. The emitted betatron radiation (pink) goes through an X-ray scintillator onto an X-ray CCD which retrieves its spectral information.</p>

<p>A further goal of the project is to improve the trapping and general properties of the electron beam. For example, the beam emittance could be improved by using different injection schemes such as self-truncated ionization injection [M. Zeng, Physics of Plasmas 21 (3), 030701 (2014)], experimentally demonstrated in [M. Mirzaie, et. al, Scientific Reports 5, 14659 (2015)] and [J. P. Couperus et. al, Nature Communications 8 (1) 487 (2017)]. Ionization injection can be achieved by adding a small percentage of Nitrogen doping to the Helium gas, and the truncation effect is due to the subsequent beam-loading. The beam energy could also be increased, leading to a higher critical energy in the betatron spectrum. One way to do this is by using a capillary to guide the laser pulse over a propagating distance much longer than the Rayleigh length, of up to a few centimeters, at a lower plasma density. Another approach is to optimize the laser and plasma parameters to obtain a better self-guiding of the laser (above the critical power) inside the gas jet, leading to an increased propagation distance.</p>
<p>The experimental developments are strongly coupled with large-scale numeric simulations, which serve a dual purpose. The first one is to guide the choice of laser (energy, duration, beam profile etc) and plasma (density, profile etc) parameters for the experimental campaign in order to optimize the accelerated electron beam’s quality and shot-to-shot reproducibility, as well as maximize its energy. The second purpose of the numeric modelling would be to confront and interpret the experimental data, leading to new physical insights.</p>
<h3 id="contribution-to-research-field-development">1.3. Contribution to research field development</h3>
<p>The main deliverable of the project should be a peer-reviewed publication in a (preferably open access) scientific journal, combining the experimental results with numerical modelling in order to achieve the main project objectives. We will also release any data analysis tools and plugins developed in the process as open source software. The data produced by the large-scale simulations will also be released as self-documented HDF5/ADIOS files using the <a href="https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-standard">openPMD standard</a>. If time permits, we will also contribute to the development of the main particle-in-cell codes used in the production runs.</p>
<p>On the experimental side, we will implement a new technique for resolving angularly the betatron spectrum emitted by the accelerated electron beam.</p>
<h2 id="case-for-hpc-europa3-funding">2. Case for HPC-Europa3 funding</h2>
<h3 id="research-benefits-of-accessing-hpc-europa-systems">2.1. Research benefits of accessing HPC-Europa systems</h3>
<p>My previous HPC experience with particle-in-cell codes includes running <code>PIConGPU</code> on the <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=12231&amp;pNid=852">HYPNOS</a> HPC cluster at the Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, which comprises of 9 GPU-compute nodes, each equipped with a dual Intel 8-Core Xeon@2.4 GHz CPU, 256 GB RAM and 4 x Nvidia K80 GPU cards. During my access time I was impressed by the order of magnitude increase in performance over popular CPU-based PIC codes.</p>
<p>We estimate that the large scale simulations relevant for this project will at least require a comparable computational power, both in terms of TFLOPS as well as total cumulated GPU memory. For the time being our institute can only provide local access to a CPU-based grid with ~300 cores, which proves inadequate for the type of 3D laser-plasma simulations necessary for this project. A separate challenge is presented by the long propagation lengths (up to a few centimeters) that have to be modelled in the case of using the discharge capillary. While the background plasma dynamics should not be a problem, the injected electrons can experience various numerical instabilities for simulaitons of over <span class="math inline">\(10^5\)</span> time steps, under the influence of the numerical dispersion produced by the field solver. Mitigating such numerical effects would require a dramatic increase in both the temporal and longitudinal resolution, leading to increased computational times and larger memory demands for storing the electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p>The calculation of the far-field angularly- and spectrally-resolved betatron emission spectrum, which could be done in situ on the GPUs, using the radiation plugin develop by R. Pausch et. al for the <code>PIConGPU</code> code, also contributes to increasing the computational time of a typical production run. Therefore, the runtime per simulation should be between 1 week to 10 days for each parameter set, and we would probably require around 200k CPU-hours in order to properly explore the parameter space. Assuming every GPU is assigned to 18 CPU cores, that would translate into ~11k GPU-hours, which is roughly 2 large-scale production runs using 30 GPUs simultaneously.</p>
<p>As far as storage space is concerned, a single simulation can produce around 1 TB output, so transferring it over the network is not a viable option – we would need to do the post-processing locally, perhaps using CPU nodes.</p>
<h3 id="research-benefits-of-interacting-with-my-local-scientific-host">2.2. Research benefits of interacting with my local scientific host</h3>
<p>I’ve met some of the members of the INFN-LNF SPARC LAB at at the recent CERN “High Gradient Wakefield Accelerator” school in Sesimbra (Portugal) and we soon discovered similar research topics with my group at ELI-NP. One of the key distinguishing features of SPARC LAB is the integration of a high-power, ultrashort Ti:Saph laser system (FLAME) with a high-brightness photo-injector. Together with a recently-developed hydrogen discharge capillary, this allows for very flexible setups in both laser wakefield (LWFA) as well as plasma wakefield (PWFA) experiments. Meanwhile, the ELI-NP project is still in its implementation phase, with preliminary experiments being scheduled for later this year, so we would definitely benefit from the extensive expertise of the Frascati group in the design and planning of future experiments. On the other hand, both groups would benefit from large-scale laser-plasma simulations using the particle-in-cell method for a better understanding of the fast dynamical phenomena that can’t usually be resolved by conventional diagnostic tools. We envision this grant to be the perfect opportunity to start a long-lasting collaboration between our research groups, with subsequent bilateral visits.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-based-project-workplan">3. Weekly-based project workplan</h2>
<h3 id="list-of-specific-objectives-and-approximate-timeline">3.1. List of specific objectives and approximate timeline</h3>
<p>On <em>week 1</em>, I will get better acquainted with the research activities and personnel at SPARC LAB, sort out any unforseen logistic problems and proceed to install the <code>fbpic</code> and <code>PIConGPU</code> particle-in-cell codes on the cluster provided by hpc-Europa and perform preliminary test runs, comparing results to well-know analytical solutions.</p>
<p>On <em>week 2</em>, I will calibrate and test the newly installed PIC codes by reproducing the previously published results from [A. Curcio et. al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 111, 133105 (2017), A. Curcio et. al, Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 20, 012801 (2017)]. This would also allow a better understanding of the underlying physical assumptions of the previously used model.</p>
<p>On <em>week 3</em>, I will estimate the optimally matched laser and plasma parameters following the analytical model of W. Lu et. al [W. Lu et. al, Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 10 (6) 061301, (2007)]. Special consideration has to be given to the case of using a the discharge capillary. Furthermore, the betatron radiation spectrum can be estimated via the scaling laws developed by A. Thomas [A. G. Thomas, Physics of Plasmas 17 (5) 056708 (2010)].</p>
<p>On <em>week 4</em>, I will proceed with a large-scale scan of the parameter space using the <code>fbpic</code> code [R. Lehe et. al, Comp. Phys. Comm. 203, 66 (2016)]. <code>fbpic</code> is a spectral, quasi-3D PIC code which also has a reduced envelope model for the laser and as such, is well suited to quick parameter scans of setups which benefit from cylindrical symmetry. Typically, uses a large number of GPUs simultaneously for such a scan, each GPU assigned to an individual start-to-end simulation for a given parameter set. Since the parameter sets are independent, there is no need for inter-GPU communication in this case. However, since the <code>fbpic</code> code doesn’t (yet) contain a plugin for calculating the far-field emitted radiation spectrum, the betatron spectrum will have to be calculated during post-processing, from the recorded electron trajectories, using the Liénard–Wiechert potentials. This requires a separate code, for which a good starting candidate would be <a href="https://github.com/hightower8083/synchrad"><code>synchrad</code></a>, perhaps with additional further development.</p>
<p>On <em>weeks 5-8</em> I will undertake full-scale PIC simulations using <code>PIConGPU</code>, for the most promising parameter sets discovered during <em>week 4</em>. <code>PIConGPU</code> [Bussmann et. al, Proc. Int. Conf. on HPC, Networking, Storage and Analysis, (2013)], a fully relativistic 3D3V code running on graphic processing units (GPUs). The code is open source, with a GPL license, and developed by the Junior Group Computational Radiation Physics at the Institute for Radiation Physics at HZDR in close collaboration with the Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing (ZIH) of the Technical University Dresden. <code>PIConGPU</code> is a parallel code, using message parsing (MPI) to communicate between various GPUs and <code>Alpaka</code>, an abstraction library for parallel kernel acceleration based on CUDA, at the single-GPU level. Due to the large memory required for simulating scenarios relevant to the current laser-plasma experiments, <code>PIConGPU</code> has to be run on multiple GPUs, with the simulation domain split up between them.</p>
<p>The production runs will be followed by converge testing and post-processing of the simulation results, in close interaction with the experimental and simulation teams from SPARC LAB. Any data analysis scripts developed in the process, as well as the simulation data itself will be released open-source for the benefit of the community. Also during this time I plan to start some simulations for preliminary ELI-NP experiments which might share some of the previously-described workflow.</p>
<p>On <em>week 8</em> I will start writing down a draft (eventually leading to peer-reviewed publication) detailing the analyzed data up to that point and any preliminary conclusions that might be reached by combining experimental data with the results of numerical modelling.</p>
<p>The numerical simulations and data analysis will then continue until the expiration date of the HPC cluster account, ~6 months after the initial visit.</p>
